# The Complete Guide Of GitHub Actions

Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository for "The Complete Guide Of GitHub Actions"! 
This is where I've been documenting my journey as I dive into the world of cloud and automation engineering through the Udemy course of the same name. 
As a fresh graduate, I'm super excited to share with you what I've been learning and discovering along the way.

## What's Inside?

### Introduction to the Basics
So, let's start from the very beginning! In this section, we're getting our feet wet with GitHub Actions. 
We'll cover all the fundamental stuff, like what they are, how they work, and how to set up our very first workflow.
It's like laying down the foundation for our automation adventures!

### Events that Trigger Workflows
Now, things start getting interesting! We're exploring all the cool events that can trigger our workflows. 
From push events to pull requests, we're learning how to make our actions react to whatever's happening in our repository.

### Expressions, Contexts, Functions & More
Okay, so expressions, contexts, functions... sounds fancy, right? But don't worry, we're breaking it all down here. 
These are like the secret sauce of GitHub Actions. They help us customize and tweak our workflows to do exactly what we want them to do.

### Diving Deeper with More Advanced GitHub Actions
Time to level up! We're taking our GitHub Actions skills to the next level with some advanced techniques. 
Think of it like unlocking new powers for your automation arsenal. We're gonna be unstoppable!

### Using Docker in GitHub Actions
Ah, Docker â€“ the superhero of containerization! In this section, we're learning how to harness the power of Docker containers in our workflows.
It's like having a magic box that can package up our applications and run them anywhere.

### Creating and Publishing Our Own Actions
Ready to become a GitHub Actions wizard? Here's where we learn how to create our very own custom actions. 
Yep, you heard that right â€“ we're making our own reusable blocks of automation awesomeness and sharing them with the world!

### Let's Create a Complete CI/CD Workflow
And now, the grand finale! We're putting it all together to build a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This is where the magic really happens â€“ automating the build, test, and deployment processes like a pro.

## Wrapping Up

Phew, what a ride! So, what have we learned from all of this? Well, GitHub Actions aren't just about automation â€“ they're about empowerment. They give us the tools to streamline our workflows, collaborate more effectively, and focus on what really matters â€“ building awesome stuff!

So, whether you're just starting out or you're a seasoned pro, I hope this repository helps you on your GitHub Actions journey. Remember, it's not just about the destination â€“ it's about the journey. So keep exploring, keep experimenting, and most importantly, keep having fun!

Cheers to automation and happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
